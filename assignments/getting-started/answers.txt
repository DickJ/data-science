Assignment 1 - Getting Started

3. It took the process 2m16.424s to run locally (output contained in out/local-out.log)
and it took 298.0s (4m58.0s) to run on AWS EMR, not counting time spent waiting for the
EC2 instances (output contained in emr-out/emr-out.log). 

4. There are 2042 "address" tags, confirmed by the locally run and the EMR run output 
(emr-out/part-00002 for EMR and out/part00001 for locally run).

5. Both versions do give the same answer. However, the EMR splits the output files. On most occasions, the locally run version
would only output one file. However, on one occasion it output two files. Combining the files and running diff on them confirms
that both files contain the same output. (emr-out/emr-combined.txt and out/local-combined.txt)
